Perfect. We’ll now move from a static website → real production platform step-by-step.
No rush. We’ll do this in phases, and I’ll clearly mark where each file goes.


---

🧭 Upgrade Roadmap (Production Phase)

We’ll cover these in order:

PHASE 1  Razorpay payments integration
PHASE 2  Individual cow detail pages
PHASE 3  Individual blog detail pages
PHASE 4  Simple admin panel (no database first)
PHASE 5  Deployment (Netlify / Vercel)

We start with PHASE 1.


---

🟢 PHASE 1 — Razorpay Payment Integration

Goal: when user clicks Donate, it opens real payment page.

There are 2 methods:

1. Payment Link (EASIEST, recommended now)


2. Full Razorpay Checkout integration (advanced)



We’ll use Payment Link first.


---

STEP 1.1 — Create Razorpay account

Go to:

https://razorpay.com

Create account → complete KYC.

Then go to:

Dashboard → Payment Links → Create Link

Example:

Title: Feed a Cow
Amount: ₹501

Razorpay gives link like:

https://rzp.io/l/abc123

Copy it.


---

STEP 1.2 — Update donate page

📁 File

src/pages/donate.astro

Find:

<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">
Donate Now
</a>

Replace with:

<a
href="https://rzp.io/l/abc123"
target="_blank"
class="btn btn-primary">

Donate Now

</a>

Now clicking opens Razorpay payment.


---

STEP 1.3 — Add Razorpay links to Cow adoption

📁 File

src/components/CowCard.astro

Find:

<a href="/donate" class="btn btn-primary">
Adopt / Sponsor
</a>

Replace:

<a
href="https://rzp.io/l/abc123"
target="_blank"
class="btn btn-primary">

Sponsor Cow

</a>


---

STEP 1.4 — Add payment to Products

📁 File

src/components/ProductCard.astro

Replace WhatsApp button with:

<a
href="https://rzp.io/l/abc123"
target="_blank"
class="btn btn-primary">

Buy Now

</a>


---

✅ Result

Now payments work from:

Donate page
Cow adoption
Products

No backend needed.


---

🟢 PHASE 1 COMPLETE

Your website can now receive real money.


---

NEXT: PHASE 2 — Individual Cow Detail Pages

Example:

/cows/lakshmi

Shows:

Photo
Full story
Sponsor button

This makes site feel real NGO platform.

We’ll implement using Astro dynamic routes.


---

If ready, I’ll give:

STEP 2.1 — Convert cows.js for dynamic routing

Now we start PHASE 2 — Individual Cow Detail Pages 🐄
This allows pages like:

/cows/lakshmi
/cows/kamadhenu

Each cow gets its own full profile page, like real goshala adoption platforms.

We’ll do this safely without breaking your current cows page.


---

STEP 2.1 — Update cows.js to include slug

Slug = URL name.

📁 File

src/data/cows.js

Replace your file with:

export const cows = [

{
id: 1,

slug: "lakshmi",

name: "Lakshmi",

age: "7 years",

breed: "Gir",

status: "Rescued",

image: "/images/cows/lakshmi.jpg",

description:
"Rescued from highway with leg injury. Now healthy and safe.",

story:
"Lakshmi was found injured on the roadside. Our team rescued her and provided medical care. Today she lives safely in our goshala."

},

{
id: 2,

slug: "kamadhenu",

name: "Kamadhenu",

age: "5 years",

breed: "Sahiwal",

status: "Healthy",

image: "/images/cows/kamadhenu.jpg",

description:
"Calm and friendly cow cared daily in our goshala.",

story:
"Kamadhenu is one of the most peaceful cows in our shelter. She was rescued from abandonment."

},

{
id: 3,

slug: "ganga",

name: "Ganga",

age: "4 years",

breed: "Desi",

status: "Under Care",

image: "/images/cows/ganga.jpg",

description:
"Receiving medical care.",

story:
"Ganga was rescued recently and is recovering under veterinary care."

}

];


---

STEP 2.2 — Update CowCard to link to cow page

📁 File

src/components/CowCard.astro

Replace button with:

<a href={`/cows/${cow.slug}`} class="btn btn-outline">

View Details

</a>

Keep sponsor button below if you want.

Example full bottom:

<br>

<a href={`/cows/${cow.slug}`} class="btn btn-outline">
View Details
</a>

<a
href="https://rzp.io/l/abc123"
target="_blank"
class="btn btn-primary">

Sponsor Cow

</a>


---

STEP 2.3 — Create dynamic cow page

Create folder:

src/pages/cows/

Create file:

src/pages/cows/[slug].astro


---

STEP 2.4 — Paste this code

📁 File

src/pages/cows/[slug].astro

---
import MainLayout from "../../layouts/MainLayout.astro";

import { cows } from "../../data/cows.js";

export function getStaticPaths(){

return cows.map(cow => ({

params: { slug: cow.slug },

props: { cow }

}));

}

const { cow } = Astro.props;
---

<MainLayout title={cow.name}>

<section class="section">

<div class="container">

<div class="grid">

<div>

<img
src={cow.image}
style="width:100%; border-radius:12px;">

</div>


<div>

<h1>
{cow.name}
</h1>

<p>
Age: {cow.age}
</p>

<p>
Breed: {cow.breed}
</p>

<p>
Status: {cow.status}
</p>

<br>

<p>
{cow.story}
</p>

<br>

<a
href="https://rzp.io/l/abc123"
target="_blank"
class="btn btn-primary">

Sponsor this Cow

</a>

</div>


</div>

</div>

</section>

</MainLayout>


---

STEP 2.5 — Run and test

npm run dev

Open:

http://localhost:4321/cows

Click:

Lakshmi → opens → /cows/lakshmi


---

✅ Result

You now have:

Individual cow pages
Dynamic routing
Real adoption profile

Professional NGO behavior.


---

📂 Folder coverage update

src/data/cows.js            ✅ UPDATED
src/components/CowCard.astro✅ UPDATED
src/pages/cows/[slug].astro ✅ NEW


---

PHASE 2 COMPLETE ✅


---

NEXT: PHASE 3 — Individual Blog Detail Pages

Example:

/blog/rescue-of-lakshmi

This improves SEO and storytelling.

Ready to proceed.



Now we start PHASE 3 — Individual Blog Detail Pages 📰
This lets each blog open as its own page, like:

/blog/rescue-of-injured-cow-lakshmi
/blog/festival-gau-seva-event

This is important for SEO, storytelling, and professionalism.

We’ll follow the same pattern as cows.


---

STEP 3.1 — Update blog.js to include slug and full content

📁 File

src/data/blog.js

Replace with:

export const blogs = [

{
id: 1,

slug: "rescue-of-lakshmi",

title: "Rescue of Injured Cow Lakshmi",

date: "March 2026",

image: "/images/blog/rescue.jpg",

excerpt:
"Our team rescued Lakshmi from roadside and provided medical care.",

content:
"Lakshmi was found injured on a busy road. Our rescue team immediately brought her to Kamadenu Goushala and provided treatment. Today she is healthy and safe thanks to supporters."

},

{
id: 2,

slug: "festival-gau-seva",

title: "Festival Gau Seva Event",

date: "February 2026",

image: "/images/blog/festival.jpg",

excerpt:
"Devotees sponsored feeding seva during festival.",

content:
"During the festival, many devotees visited our goshala and sponsored feeding seva. It was a blessed day for all cows and volunteers."

},

{
id: 3,

slug: "new-shelter",

title: "New Shelter Construction",

date: "January 2026",

image: "/images/blog/shelter.jpg",

excerpt:
"We expanded our shelter.",

content:
"Our goshala expanded the shelter to protect more rescued cows. This was made possible by generous donations."

}

];


---

STEP 3.2 — Update BlogCard to link to detail page

📁 File

src/components/BlogCard.astro

Replace Read More button:

<a href={`/blog/${blog.slug}`} class="btn btn-outline">

Read More

</a>


---

STEP 3.3 — Create dynamic blog page

Create folder if needed:

src/pages/blog/

Create file:

src/pages/blog/[slug].astro


---

STEP 3.4 — Paste this code

📁 File

src/pages/blog/[slug].astro

---
import MainLayout from "../../layouts/MainLayout.astro";

import { blogs } from "../../data/blog.js";

export function getStaticPaths(){

return blogs.map(blog => ({

params: { slug: blog.slug },

props: { blog }

}));

}

const { blog } = Astro.props;
---

<MainLayout title={blog.title}>

<section class="section">

<div class="container">

<h1>
{blog.title}
</h1>

<p style="color:#888;">
{blog.date}
</p>

<br>

<img
src={blog.image}
style="width:100%; max-width:700px; border-radius:12px;">

<br><br>

<p>
{blog.content}
</p>

</div>

</section>

</MainLayout>


---

STEP 3.5 — Test

Run:

npm run dev

Open:

http://localhost:4321/blog

Click:

Read More

It opens:

/blog/rescue-of-lakshmi


---

✅ Result

You now have:

Blog listing page
Individual blog pages
Dynamic routing

This is how real NGO blogs work.


---

📂 Folder coverage update

src/data/blog.js              ✅ UPDATED
src/components/BlogCard.astro✅ UPDATED
src/pages/blog/[slug].astro  ✅ NEW


---

PHASE 3 COMPLETE ✅


---

NEXT: PHASE 4 — Simple Admin Panel

This allows you to:

Add cows
Add blogs
Add products

without editing code manually.

We’ll start with a simple file-based admin first (no database).



Great. Now we start PHASE 4 — Simple Admin Panel (No Database, beginner-friendly).
This will let you add cows, blogs, and products without touching the UI pages, just by editing structured files. Later we can upgrade to a real CMS.

We’ll do it in two stages:

1. File-based admin system (now) ✅


2. Real admin dashboard with login (later)




---

🟢 PHASE 4.1 — Convert data into structured “admin-editable” format

You already have:

src/data/
 ├ cows.js
 ├ blog.js
 └ products.js

We’ll improve structure so adding new entries is easy and safe.


---

STEP 4.1 — Improve cows.js format

📁 File

src/data/cows.js

Update to this structure:

export const cows = [

{
id: "cow-001",

slug: "lakshmi",

name: "Lakshmi",

age: "7 years",

breed: "Gir",

status: "Rescued",

sponsorAmount: 3000,

image: "/images/cows/lakshmi.jpg",

description:
"Rescued from highway with leg injury.",

story:
"Lakshmi was rescued and treated. She now lives safely."

},

{
id: "cow-002",

slug: "kamadhenu",

name: "Kamadhenu",

age: "5 years",

breed: "Sahiwal",

status: "Healthy",

sponsorAmount: 2500,

image: "/images/cows/kamadhenu.jpg",

description:
"Healthy and calm cow.",

story:
"Kamadhenu is peaceful and loved by visitors."

}

];

Now admin only edits this file.


---

STEP 4.2 — Improve blog.js

📁 File

src/data/blog.js

export const blogs = [

{
id: "blog-001",

slug: "rescue-of-lakshmi",

title: "Rescue of Lakshmi",

date: "2026-03-01",

author: "Kamadenu Team",

image: "/images/blog/rescue.jpg",

excerpt:
"Lakshmi was rescued and treated.",

content:
"Full rescue story here."

}

];


---

STEP 4.3 — Improve products.js

📁 File

src/data/products.js

export const products = [

{
id: "prod-001",

name: "Cow Dung Cakes",

price: 150,

image: "/images/products/dung-cakes.jpg",

description:
"Organic dung cakes for pooja.",

paymentLink:
"https://rzp.io/l/yourlink"

}

];


---

🟢 PHASE 4.2 — Create hidden Admin Page

This lets admin view and copy structure easily.


---

📁 File

src/pages/admin.astro

Paste:

---
import MainLayout from "../layouts/MainLayout.astro";

import { cows } from "../data/cows.js";

import { blogs } from "../data/blog.js";

import { products } from "../data/products.js";
---

<MainLayout title="Admin">

<section class="section">

<div class="container">

<h1 class="section-title">
Admin Panel (File-Based)
</h1>

<h2>Cows</h2>

<pre>
{JSON.stringify(cows, null, 2)}
</pre>

<h2>Blogs</h2>

<pre>
{JSON.stringify(blogs, null, 2)}
</pre>

<h2>Products</h2>

<pre>
{JSON.stringify(products, null, 2)}
</pre>

<p>
Edit files inside <b>src/data/</b> to add content.
</p>

</div>

</section>

</MainLayout>


---

STEP 4.3 — Test admin page

Run:

npm run dev

Open:

http://localhost:4321/admin

You’ll see all data.


---

✅ Result

You now have a basic admin system where:

Admin edits:

src/data/cows.js
src/data/blog.js
src/data/products.js

Website updates automatically.

No database needed.


---

🟢 PHASE 4 COMPLETE (Basic Admin)


---

NEXT: PHASE 4.5 — REAL Admin Dashboard (Optional but powerful)

Options:

Option A — Netlify CMS (recommended)
Option B — Decap CMS
Option C — Custom Node admin
